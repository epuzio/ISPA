        "review": `"Your Clothes" was the song that first introduced me to Jane Remover, and while I prefer her style on "Census Designated", "Frailty" is an incredible time capsule of 2020s hyperpop and Jane herself as an artist. I'm sad that the promotional ARG surrounding this album's release was scrapped - the pieces that survived provided a lot of context for the locations and time frames referenced on the album.

Full of good, personal, danceable hits, but less-structured songs like "i think about it all the time" or "Girl, so confusing" don't hold their own against "Von Dutch" or "Sympathy is a Knife" - in my opinion, this stream-of-consciousness writing style doesn't suit A.G. Cook's production. Regardless, Charli's it-girl persona is infectious, and BRAT makes the most mundane tasks feel fresh.

I deeply respect the impact she made in pioneering pop/hyperpop, but her work focuses more on sound than song, and as a result most tracks felt like technical demonstrations rather than compositions. I really did want to love this album and I hope her posthumous release changes my judgements.

        "review": `Thrilled to experience this live. JPEGMAFIA has an incredible gift for picking samples and a willingness to draw those samples from truly baffling sources. Watching underscores break down her production style on “Heck” made me appreciate artists who hear a random sound effect (like a line in Succession!) and think "I can build a song around this”. It takes a lot of musical/cultural knowledge to do that, plus heavy faith in your own abilities as a producer to make something cohesive - thoroughly impressed.

This was one of my top albums this year and what introduced me to Arca's body of work, and it's the strongest of the quintet, with the possible exception of KiCK ii. The emotional and sonic shift from Nonbinary to Time is incredible and really characterizes the album and the direction Arca's music would take, and KiCK seems to build upon the promise for the future of music that SOPHIE's Oil Of Every Pearl's Uninsides established in 2018.

Kick ii is emotionally vulnerable even in moments of strength and confidence, and sets up for the slower pace of Kick iiii and iiiii.

                    I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did! Liz Phair's lyricism/word choices are very complex for the subject matter. 
                    Her songs also have a rawness to them that resonates with me so rarely, and it sounds more personal here than
                    on albums like "brat" which received similar commercial praise for authenticity. The imagery of "Stratford on Guy" was
                    memorable in my first listen, and on repeated listens I've found myself drawn to the parables in "Divorce Song" and "Fuck and Run".

                   It's been interesting to watch JPEGMAFIA's production thoroughly transform following "SCARING THE HOES" and his collaboration with Danny Brown. This album had a few standouts,
                   but overall didn't capture me as much as "I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU" did.

The way Hanatan's voice can go from cutesy to a full belt is impressive. KikuoHana songs feel more operatic as a result of Hanatan’s range as opposed to the crisp, fairy-tale sound Miku’s tuning provides. Filing this album (along with Official Orange) under my mental image of the ideal Dorohedoro soundtrack.`,
