                    "Your Clothes" was the song that first introduced me to Jane Remover, and while I prefer her style
                    on "Census Designated", "Frailty" is an incredible time capsule of 2020s hyperpop and Jane herself as an artist.
                    I'm sad that the promotional ARG surrounding this album's release was scrapped - the pieces that survived
                    provided a lot of context for the locations and time frames referenced on the album.

                    Incredible to experience live. On my initial listen, I thought there were too
                    many songs on this album, but over time I think that the standouts from this album
                    really hold their own. JPEGMAFIA has an incredible gift for picking samples and
                    a willingness to draw those samples from truly baffling sources. Watching underscores 
                    break down her production style on “Heck” made me appreciate artists who hear a random sound effect
                    (like a Hanna Barbera scream! Or a line in Succession!) and think "I can build a song around this”. 
                    It takes a lot of musical/cultural knowledge to do that, plus heavy faith in your own abilities as a producer
                    to make something cohesive - thoroughly impressed.

                    My initial thoughts: hard to ease into, but after the first few listens almost every song becomes addictive. 
                    This was one of my top albums this year and what introduced me to Arca's body of work, and it's the strongest
                    of the Kick quintet, with the possible exception of KiCK ii. The emotional and sonic shift from Nonbinary to Time
                    is incredible and really characterizes the album, and KiCK seems to build upon the promise for the future of music that SOPHIE's
                    Oil Of Every Pearl's Uninsides established in 2018. My one critique is that many songs weren't as complex as I'd hoped,
                    and songs like La Chíqui appear to be right on the cusp of a maximalist drop before they avert it entirely.

                    I liked the singles that I'd already heard from the album, but no other song stuck out to me, and even the singles weren't too memorable. 
                    Good background music, or I need to listen to it a few more times, but I expected more from AG Cook + EASYFUN given their previous work.

                    A more rock-esque direction for Black Dresses, which I ended up enjoying! 
                    Devi's vocals are softer on this one which is an interesting change of pace, 
                    and I loved the mental image painted by songs like IF YOU FIND ME GONE. 
                    The background for the release of this album provides context for the length and quality 
                    of many of the songs on it, and I'm left wondering how many of Ada or Devi's lyrics are about the other.

                    I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did! Liz Phair's lyricism/word choices are very complex for the subject matter. 
                    Her songs also have a rawness to them that resonates with me so rarely, and it sounds more personal here than
                    on albums like "brat" which received similar commercial praise for authenticity. The imagery of "Stratford on Guy" was
                    memorable in my first listen, and on repeated listens I've found myself drawn to the parables in "Divorce Song" and "Fuck and Run".

                   It's been interesting to watch JPEGMAFIA's production thoroughly transform following "SCARING THE HOES" and his collaboration with Danny Brown. This album had a few standouts,
                   but overall didn't capture me as much as "I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU" did.

                   Sabrina Carpenter's persona irritated me this album, especially given the context of her dynamic with Olivia Rodrigo.
                   Then again, I'm not a fan of pop, so I don't know what I was expecting. The production is good, albeit generic, but I preferred her singing (and persona) on fruitcake.

                   This is the final Black Dresses album I had yet to listen to, and in my opinion it's their weakest.
                   The rock direction they take this album makes many songs sound similar, and unlike LAUGHINGFISH there were
                   no standout singles that grabbed my attention.
