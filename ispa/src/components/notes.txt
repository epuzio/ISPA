Notes on the albums.json file/formatting:

Eventually, this information will be pulled directly using the Spotify API from the ISPA playlist.

Fields:
ID: title of the album - may not be necessary, albums should have unique names? ID can also be title+artist+year combo
Name: title of album. Used to display in scroll bar.
Artist: artist, display in scroll bar
Genre: determines font in scroll bar
release_date: determines sprite in scroll bar.

Based on the albums release date, the scroll bar should appear more damaged/dusty.
There should be 4 possible values: released before 8-2002, released before 6-2020, released before 1-2024, released after 1-2024
(my birth month, my graduation month, when I started this project)
(these categories are a little unintuitive, but they provide the most diversity based on the albums i've selected)
